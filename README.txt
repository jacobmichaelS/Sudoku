To test it out, just run it on localhost.  It works the best in Google Chrome.

Things left to do:
-Reformat sudoku grid so that it doesn’t break when Zoom is something other than 100%
-Hook up to a backend of some sort — Firebase, perhaps?
-Create an alert when a user solves a Sudoku puzzle successfully
-Add a timer so a user can see how long he is taking to solve the puzzle
-Reorganize the files/dependencies that are floating around in the main directory.
-Add content to the other pages instead of just having Lorem Ipsum
-Reconsider how index.html is structured
